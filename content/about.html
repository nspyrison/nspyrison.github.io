<p>I am PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Austalia, researching high dimensional visualization. In the same way that shadow puppets project light from a 3D object down to a 2D shadow, you can do the same with a 5-dimensional (or higher!) data. This is not to imply more than 3 spatial dimensions, donâ€™t get me started on String Theory!</p>
<p>I am researching, and greatfully so, with two lovely world-class professors, <a href="http://www.dicook.org/">Di Cook</a> and <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott">Kim Marriott</a>.</p>
<p><!-- I am author of the R package **spinifex** [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html), [Dev version](https://github.com/nspyrison/spinifex) --></p>
<p>I enjoy cycling, comedy (especially observational and dead-pan), and board games. I have been practicing Buddhism since 2006 and have been though lay Buddhist ordination, Jukai (a ceremony akin to a formal version of Chrisian Confermation).</p>
