<p>I am PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Austalia, researching high dimensional visualization. In the same way that shadow puppets project light from a 3D object down to a 2D shadow, you can do the same with a 5-dimensional (or higher!) data. This is not to imply more than 3 spatial dimensions, donâ€™t get me started on String Theory!</p>
<p>I am researching, and gratefully so, with two lovely world-class professors, <a href="http://www.dicook.org/">Di Cook</a> and <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott">Kim Marriott</a>.</p>
<p>I love dogs and advocate for mental illnesses. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, comedy (especially observational and dead-pan), and board games. I have been practicing Soto Zen Buddhism since 2006 and have been though lay Buddhist ordination, Jukai, which is a formal statement of my belief and commitment to the lineage.</p>
