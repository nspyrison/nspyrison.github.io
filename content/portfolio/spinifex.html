<p>Shadow puppets are a projection of a 3D object down to a 2D shadow. In the same way, you can project higher data spaces down to 2D. Information about data structure is revealed by rotating the data and watching the shadow change!
<code>spinifex</code> is an open-source R package that enables manual control of a linear projection of multivariate data.</p>
<p><em>why, thou?</em>
Using numeric statistics often leaves obvious visual trends overlooked, this is why data visualization is so important! Unfortunately, graphing at more than 3 variables at a time is difficult. This is where dimension reduction is used!</p>
