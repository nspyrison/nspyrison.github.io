I am PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Austalia, researching high dimensional visualization. In the same way that shadow puppets project light from a 3D object down to a 2D shadow, you can do the same with a 5-dimensional (or higher!) data. This is not to imply more than 3 spatial dimensions, don't get me started on String Theory!

I am researching, and greatfully so, with two lovely world-class professors, [Di Cook](http://www.dicook.org/) and [Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott).

# I am author of the R package **spinifex** [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spinifex/index.html), [Dev version](https://github.com/nspyrison/spinifex)
