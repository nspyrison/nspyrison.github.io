## Introduction

Well,
I'm a fry cook and I don't really know where that leaves us.

**Lesson leanred**
* images belong in /static/ and are harder to work with, 
* Blogdown executes in a different work directory, so to speak

for example: 
image `helloworld_gif.gif` \\ 
should reside in `./static/else/helloworld_gif.gif` \\
and be referenced as `/else/helloworld_gif.gif` \\
although in .rmd we would use `../../static/else/helloworld_gif.gif`

using `/else/helloworld_gif.gif`
![](/else/helloworld_gif.gif)
