I am PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne Austalia, researching high dimensional visualization. In the same way that shadow puppets project light from a 3D object down to a 2D shadow, you can do the same with a `p>3`-dimensional data. This is not to imply more than 3 spatial dimensions, don't get me started on String Theory!

I am researching, and gratefully so, with two lovely world-class professors, [Di Cook](http://www.dicook.org/) and [Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott).


I love dogs and advocate for mental illnesses. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, comedy (especially observational and dead-pan), and board games. I have been practicing Soto Zen Buddhism since 2006 and have been though lay Buddhist ordination, Jukai, which is a formal statement of my belief and commitment to the lineage.
