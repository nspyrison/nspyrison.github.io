I am PhD student at Monash University studying high dimension projections, working with [Di Cook](http://www.dicook.org/) and [Kim Marriott](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/kimbal-marriott).

I am author of the [spinifex package](https://github.com/nspyrison/spinifex), yet to be submitted to CRAN. My future work will include an experimental study of high dimension projections across display type and extending dimension reduction into virtual spaces for immersive analytics.
