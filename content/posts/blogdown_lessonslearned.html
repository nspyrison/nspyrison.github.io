<p>This is my two cents and notes on some of the struggles I’ve come across standing up my site. I hope this helps others. There is a wealth of great resources for getting started (see links below).</p>

<div id="lessons-learned" class="section level2">
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The repository directory can look a bit confusing at first. The gist is…
<ul>
<li>content: compilable files such as .md, .rmd go here, this is where most of the leg work happens on your end.</li>
<li>static: images, gif, and other files that are refenced in the above section belong here.</li>
<li>public: when blogdown does it’s build it throws everything together in this folder and is what hosts are looking at. You don’t want to change files here, but there are automated moving pieces when the site is built.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t use nspyrison.github.io for hosting agnosticism, for your first netlify go.
<ul>
<li>Maybe taking Emi’s hard path inadvertently (netlify and github at the same time).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resolving Netlify build error 255:
<ul>
<li><strong>tldr:</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check your theme’s min hugo versions <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">here</a></li>
<li>In R run <code>blogdown::hugo_version()</code>
<ul>
<li>if you need a newer ver run <code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>On Netlify navigate to Settings (tab along top) &gt; Build &amp; Deploy (menu on left) &gt; scroll down to the Build environment variables section &gt; Edit variables (button)
<ul>
<li>edit or add a Key of “HUGO_VERSION” and Value of your hugo version (<em>ie.</em> “0.53”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>For more through documentation, see Mara’s <a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/updating-blogdown-hugo-version-netlify/">post</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Resolving: “Error building site:”C:&lt;some path&gt;.rda:1:1“: unmarshal of format”" is not supported"
<ul>
<li>SOLUTION: make /data/ (or any file referenced in an .rmd) is in static/data/ or the static directory. Didn’t have to fix .rmd, and serve_site() resolved.</li>
<li>symptoms: looks like standard .rda file is the wrong format. Changing data type and file type doesn’t resolve.</li>
<li>symptoms: can knit .rmd locally, cannot <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> or Build, Build Website
<!--     * workaround workflow: (avoid using, fix is easy enough) -->
<!--         1. `rmarkdown::clean_site()` (Build, More, Clean all) -->
<!--         2. `blogdown::build_site()`, wait for the build, takes a few minutes for me building 70 MB of manual tours. Runs on the console. (NOT build_dir(), do not run from build tab.) -->
<!--         3. Push to Github (use kraken or terminal as sizes are large), hope netlify builds. Works as of SHA 6eebb990. -->
<!--         * *note* no offline dev; changes are now "devele-prod" -->
<!-- * Hidden spelling errors (ie. Theses from thesis), the folders are automatically made plural, space characters in folders don't work either. -->
<!--     * solution: leaving as Theses for now. may change later. --></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
