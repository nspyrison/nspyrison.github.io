Blogdown accepts .md or .rmd files, write as though it's any other .rmd file. links are made with [txt](link) and images are made with ![hover_txt](img)Keep in mind the [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and your favorite .rmd settings.

Remember to store `static` files like images and data in `./static/` (ie. `./static/MyFolder/Pic1.png`) and reference them from relative to the stat folder`![My picture](MyFolder/Pic1.png)`. Will they kniw correctly?


## R code

Hello world for my blogdown site.


```{r}
"hello world, now in an `R` chunk!"

head(mtcars)
```

## Static files -- images and data

Dr. Navarro has a long post about this [here](https://djnavarro.net/post/starting-blogdown/)
store: `./static/` (ie. `./static/MyFolder/Pic1.png`)
use: `![My picture](MyFolder/Pic1.png)`, that is refernece from static folder.
